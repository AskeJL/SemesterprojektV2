| Looks like you somehow managed to |
| forget to calibrate the scanner   |
| before using it. Silly human.     |
|                                   |
| No matter. It is a rather simple  |
| task to do: head to the           |
| calibrator in the room to your    |
| right, activate the calibrator    |
| and reactivate the scanner.       |
