| After having left Earth's atmosphere, I can      |
| finally see the spaceship LEO Control 153, on    |
| which I am to spend the next 3 months as a       |
| low Earth orbit debris controller (LEODC).       |
|                                                  |
| The job of a LEODC is fairly simple, as my main  |
| task is to oversee the AI of the spaceship and   |
| ensure that the ship function as intended.       |
|                                                  |
| I wonder what the future has in store for me.    |
