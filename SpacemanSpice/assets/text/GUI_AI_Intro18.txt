| This tutorial should have given   |
| you the basic information you     |
| will need to play Spaceman Spice. |
| AI's are allowed to break the     |
| fourth wall.                      |
|                                   |
| To get a better understanding of  |
| everyting, I suggest running      |
| around the ship for a while to    |
| familiarize yourself with the     |
| different locations, and to       |
| create a mental map of where the  |
| different locations are.          |
|                                   |
| Whenever you feel ready to begin  |
| the game propperly, type "start". |
|                                   |
| To skip the tutorial when         |
| you restart the game, just type   |
| "start" at the start of the game. |
| Good luck and have fun!           |
