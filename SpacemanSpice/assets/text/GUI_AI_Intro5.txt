| Looks like you somehow managed to forget to      |
| calibrate the scanner before useing it. Silly    |
| human.                                           |
|                                                  |
| No matter. It is a rather simple task to do:     |
| When you interact with the scanner, you should   |
| be given a sequence of numbers. You will need to |
| put those numbers into the calibrators to the    |
| right of here.                                   |
| If you manage to enter the wrong number in a     |
| calibrator, you can always reset them by         |
| reactivating the scanner.                        |
| When you are done, interact with the scanner.    |
