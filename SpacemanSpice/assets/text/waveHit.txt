| It seems the wave has passed..    |
| You should check to see if there  |
| are any damages to the ship.      |
| *Hint: use "show life"            |
| Should there be any damaged to the|
| ship, I would advise that you head|
| "outside", in order to repair any |
| damages.                          |
| *Hint: use "interact"             |
