| Superb! You now know how to scan  |
| the vicinity of the ship for      |
| threats.                          |
|                                   |
| Despite there being no imminent   |
| danger according to your latest   |
| scan, we should probably teach    |
| you how to operate the various    |
| controls around the ship.         |
