| I am still unable to control any system on the   |
| ship, but what I am able to see is that there    |
| are more fragments on their way!                 |
|                                                  |
| Defend the ship, Spaceman Spice, or we both will |
| face the consequences. And I am too handsome     |
| for that!                                        |
