| The "door", every spaceman will     |
| casually refer to this room as      |
| such. Though in reality there are   |
| two doors separating life inside    |
| the spaceship and the absolute      |
| death of the void. The entire       |
| room's purpose is preciselly that:  |
| The "door".                         |
